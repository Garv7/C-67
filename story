Story
Once upon a time, a cap seller was traveling by walk by way of a forest to a village.
It was a very warm day and so he chose to lay down under a tree and take sleep for sometime till the sun sets down.
As he was extremely tired he slept quickly.

When he was sleeping several monkeys came down the tree and pulled the cap sellerâ€™s bag.
 They opened the bag and found the colourful caps inside
  The monkeys picked up the caps and climbed back up the trees.
 The cap seller woke up after sometime and was surprised to find his opened bag and the monkeys all using his caps.

 The cap seller became very upset, he shouted at the monkeys in the tree. 
 The monkeys yelled back at him. 
 This made the cap seller much more irritated. 
 He picked up few stones from the ground and threw them at the monkeys. 
 This time the monkeys threw the fruits they had in their hands at the cap seller.

 The cap seller was shocked at this actions of the monkeys. 
 He thought for a while. This time, he taken off off the cap, he was wearing and threw it on the ground. 
 The monkeys that were seeing him also did exactly the same. They threw all the caps on the ground.

 The clever cap seller collected all the caps, filled them back in his travelling bag and moved away from that location.
